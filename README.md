# Installation

For your convenience, it is available on jCenter, So just add this in your app dependencies:
```gradle
    compile 'lib.kashif:folderpicker:2.2'
```
  
# Usage

**To pick folder**

Just start FolderPicker activity from your app
```java
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, FolderPicker.class);
        startActivityForResult(intent, FOLDERPICKER_CODE);        
```

If the user selects folder/file, the name of folder/file will be returned to you on onActivityResult method with the variable name 'data'.

```java
        
        protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {
          if (requestCode == FOLDERPICKER_CODE && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {

              String folderLocation = intent.getExtras().getString("data");
              Log.i( "folderLocation", folderLocation );
            
          }
        }
        
 ```

**Options**

Cusstomization options can be passed as extras to FolderPicker activity.

 ```java
 
        //To show a custom title
        intent.putExtra("title", "Select file to upload");
        
        //To begin from a selected folder instead of sd card's root folder. Example : Pictures directory
        intent.putExtra("location", Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES).getAbsolutePath());
        
        //To pick files
        intent.putExtra("pickFiles", true);

        //To set on landscape mode
        intent.putExtra("landscape", true);
        
  ```
